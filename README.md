## Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic save game editor
Version: 0.1a

Author: Lee Hutchinson

This script provides a command-line interface for editing save game files
from the 1989 MS-DOS game "Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic".

The editor can modify:
- Party cash and light energy
- Individual character stats, abilities, and inventory
- Ship software levels

### Usage
Run the script and follow the interactive prompts to edit your SW1 saves.

You currently need to provide your own GAMEA.FM and GAMEB.FM files.

The files currently need to be located in a directory named /test_data/
beneath the project root directory, and they need to be named GAMEA.FM
and GAMEB.FM.

Everything should work. It's been mostly tested.
