## Things we have done so far:
- We've created a main menu loop.
- We've added functions for multi-byte reading and multi-byte writing.
- We've validated our read/writes by enabling cash editing.
- Cash editing works.
- Saving the edited file works.
- We have also added everything necessary for light editing and validated that it works.
- We've added ship software editing and validated it works.
- We've added the functions to handle the party member submenu and its options, specifically the party member selection menu. This is in and validated. We can pick crewpersons 1-5, and also back out.
- We got to the point of displaying this option for the selected crewmember:
  - 1) Edit characteristics
  - 2) Edit abilities
  - 3) Edit HP
  - 4) Edit equipment
- "Edit characteristics" is implemented and functional
- "Edit HP" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit Abilities" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit equipment" is implemented and functional.
- **NEW: Added character name support**
  - Added name address constants for all 5 crew members to sw_constants.py
  - Created read_string() and write_string() functions for handling ASCII strings
  - Updated data structures to include 'name' field for each crew member
  - Modified load_save_game() to read character names from save files
  - Modified save_game() to write character names back to save files
  - Updated all display menus to show character names alongside crew member numbers
  - Character names now appear in: party select menu, character edit menu, equipment display, characteristics editing, abilities editing, and HP editing
- **NEW: Consolidated read/write functions (completed TODOs #1 and #2)**
  - Created unified read_bytes() function (replaces read_byte() and read_multi_bytes())
  - Created unified write_bytes() function (replaces write_byte() and write_multi_bytes())
  - Both new functions use default parameter num_bytes=1 for single-byte operations
  - Updated all function calls throughout the codebase to use the new unified functions
  - Removed duplicate code and improved maintainability
- **NEW: Flexible file path system with comprehensive validation**
  - Added command-line argument support: can now run `python main.py path/to/gamea.fm`
  - Replaced hardcoded GAMEA.FM/GAMEB.FM with flexible path input
  - Support for any gameX.fm filename (X = A-Z, case-insensitive)
  - Added DEFAULT_SAVE_PATH constant (currently "test_data") for quick file selection
  - Comprehensive file validation:
    - File existence and readability checks
    - File size validation (must be 1KB-16KB)
    - Sentinel Worlds signature verification at 0x3181 (checks for "Sentinel" bytes)
    - Filename pattern matching (gameX.fm where X is A-Z)
    - Directory write permission check (required for saving and backups)
  - Automatic backup creation (.bak files) before editing
  - Exits with clear error if write permissions are missing
  - Supports ~ expansion and relative/absolute paths
  - Interactive mode with helpful prompts and examples
- **NEW: Beta Release Preparation (v0.5b → v0.7b)**
  - Updated version number from 0.1a to 0.5b in main.py header and --version output
  - Updated version to 0.7b across all files (pyproject.toml, main.py, gui.py)
  - Updated README.md to reflect beta status and current features
  - Rewrote README.md Usage section with comprehensive installation/usage instructions
  - Documented flexible file path support and command-line arguments
- **NEW: pip Package Installation Setup**
  - Created pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging
  - Package name: sentinel-worlds-editor
  - Creates executable command: `sw-editor` (can be run from anywhere after pip install)
  - Supports both installation methods:
    - Local: `pip install .` from project directory
    - Git: `pip install git+https://gitea-server/repo.git` directly from repository
  - Fixed module imports to work both ways:
    - When pip-installed: imports from `src.` package
    - When run directly: imports from local modules
    - Uses try/except to handle both cases transparently
  - Updated inventory_constants.py imports to match
  - Added `# type: ignore` comments to suppress Pylance warnings on wildcard imports
  - Updated pyrightconfig.json to disable reportUnboundVariable/reportUndefinedVariable
  - Tested and verified both execution methods work:
    - Direct execution: `python3 src/main.py`
    - Pip-installed: `sw-editor`
  - No PyPI publishing required - users can install directly from Git repo or local directory
  - Professional distribution method without code signing complexity

- **NEW: Code Organization and Refactoring**
  - Reorganized all functions in main.py into 10 logical sections with visual separators:
    - File Validation & Path Management
    - Low-Level File I/O Operations
    - Data Structure Management
    - Display Functions
    - Input Validation Helpers
    - Menu Handlers
    - Edit Functions - Equipment
    - Edit Functions - Character Stats
    - Edit Functions - Ship & Party
    - Main Entry Point
  - Added clear section headers (============) for easy navigation
  - Removed duplicate functions discovered during reorganization
  - Improved code readability and maintainability
  - Validated syntax with `python3 -m py_compile`
- **NEW: GUI Version with Tkinter (v0.5b → v0.7b)**
  - Created complete GUI application in src/gui.py using Tkinter (cross-platform, no dependencies)
  - Added second entry point: `sw-editor-gui` alongside existing `sw-editor` CLI
  - GUI Features:
    - Menu bar with File operations (Open, Save, Exit) and keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+O, Cmd+S, Cmd+Q)
    - Left panel: Tree navigation showing Party, Ship, and all 5 Crew Members with expandable sections
    - Right panel: Dynamic editor that changes based on tree selection
    - Status bar: Shows current file name and unsaved changes indicator (red "● Unsaved changes")
    - Automatic backup creation on file open
    - Unsaved changes warning on exit
  - Full editing support for all game data:
    - Party cash with validation (max: 655,359)
    - Light energy with validation (max: 254)
    - Ship software (MOVE, TARGET, ENGINE, LASER) with validation (max: 100)
    - Crew characteristics (5 stats per member) with validation (max: 100)
    - Crew abilities (12 skills per member) with validation (max: 100)
    - Crew HP with validation (max: 255)
    - Crew equipment with filtered dropdown menus:
      - Equipped Armor: dropdown filtered to VALID_ARMOR items only
      - Equipped Weapon: dropdown filtered to VALID_WEAPONS items only
      - On-hand Weapons (3 slots): dropdown filtered to VALID_WEAPONS items only
      - Inventory (8 slots): dropdown filtered to VALID_INVENTORY (all valid items)
  - User-friendly interface improvements:
    - Human-readable item names ("Neutron Gun") instead of hex codes (0x1B)
    - Alphabetically sorted dropdown lists
    - Current values pre-selected in all dropdowns
    - Scrollable interfaces for long lists (abilities, equipment)
    - Clear validation messages via dialog boxes
    - All numeric fields show maximum allowed values
  - Technical implementation:
    - Shared `save_game_data` between GUI and CLI via `main_module` reference
    - Proper module imports work both pip-installed and when run directly
    - Installed Tkinter support for Python 3.13 via `brew install python-tk@3.13`
    - Editable pip install (`pip install -e .`) allows immediate testing of code changes
  - Both versions (CLI and GUI) fully functional and maintained in parallel

## What to do next:
- Testing and polish for GUI version
- Consider adding more user-friendly features (drag-and-drop file opening, recent files menu, etc.)
