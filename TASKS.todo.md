## Things we have done so far:
- We've created a main menu loop.
- We've added functions for multi-byte reading and multi-byte writing.
- We've validated our read/writes by enabling cash editing.
- Cash editing works.
- Saving the edited file works.
- We have also added everything necessary for light editing and validated that it works.
- We've added ship software editing and validated it works.
- We've added the functions to handle the party member submenu and its options, specifically the party member selection menu. This is in and validated. We can pick crewpersons 1-5, and also back out.
- We got to the point of displaying this option for the selected crewmember:
  - 1) Edit characteristics
  - 2) Edit abilities
  - 3) Edit HP
  - 4) Edit equipment
- "Edit characteristics" is implemented and functional
- "Edit HP" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit Abilities" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit equipment" is implemented and functional.
- **NEW: Added character name support**
  - Added name address constants for all 5 crew members to sw_constants.py
  - Created read_string() and write_string() functions for handling ASCII strings
  - Updated data structures to include 'name' field for each crew member
  - Modified load_save_game() to read character names from save files
  - Modified save_game() to write character names back to save files
  - Updated all display menus to show character names alongside crew member numbers
  - Character names now appear in: party select menu, character edit menu, equipment display, characteristics editing, abilities editing, and HP editing
- **NEW: Consolidated read/write functions (completed TODOs #1 and #2)**
  - Created unified read_bytes() function (replaces read_byte() and read_multi_bytes())
  - Created unified write_bytes() function (replaces write_byte() and write_multi_bytes())
  - Both new functions use default parameter num_bytes=1 for single-byte operations
  - Updated all function calls throughout the codebase to use the new unified functions
  - Removed duplicate code and improved maintainability

## What to do next:
- UX/UI needs huge improvements. This is a good place to focus.
