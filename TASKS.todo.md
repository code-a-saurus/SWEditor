## Things we have done so far:
- We've created a main menu loop.
- We've added functions for multi-byte reading and multi-byte writing.
- We've validated our read/writes by enabling cash editing.
- Cash editing works.
- Saving the edited file works.
- We have also added everything necessary for light editing and validated that it works.
- We've added ship software editing and validated it works.
- We've added the functions to handle the party member submenu and its options, specifically the party member selection menu. This is in and validated. We can pick crewpersons 1-5, and also back out.
- We got to the point of displaying this option for the selected crewmember:
  - 1) Edit characteristics
  - 2) Edit abilities
  - 3) Edit HP
  - 4) Edit equipment
- "Edit characteristics" is implemented and functional
- "Edit HP" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit Abilities" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit equipment" is implemented and functional.
- **NEW: Added character name support**
  - Added name address constants for all 5 crew members to sw_constants.py
  - Created read_string() and write_string() functions for handling ASCII strings
  - Updated data structures to include 'name' field for each crew member
  - Modified load_save_game() to read character names from save files
  - Modified save_game() to write character names back to save files
  - Updated all display menus to show character names alongside crew member numbers
  - Character names now appear in: party select menu, character edit menu, equipment display, characteristics editing, abilities editing, and HP editing
- **NEW: Consolidated read/write functions (completed TODOs #1 and #2)**
  - Created unified read_bytes() function (replaces read_byte() and read_multi_bytes())
  - Created unified write_bytes() function (replaces write_byte() and write_multi_bytes())
  - Both new functions use default parameter num_bytes=1 for single-byte operations
  - Updated all function calls throughout the codebase to use the new unified functions
  - Removed duplicate code and improved maintainability
- **NEW: Flexible file path system with comprehensive validation**
  - Added command-line argument support: can now run `python main.py path/to/gamea.fm`
  - Replaced hardcoded GAMEA.FM/GAMEB.FM with flexible path input
  - Support for any gameX.fm filename (X = A-Z, case-insensitive)
  - Added DEFAULT_SAVE_PATH constant (currently "test_data") for quick file selection
  - Comprehensive file validation:
    - File existence and readability checks
    - File size validation (must be 1KB-16KB)
    - Sentinel Worlds signature verification at 0x3181 (checks for "Sentinel" bytes)
    - Filename pattern matching (gameX.fm where X is A-Z)
    - Directory write permission check (required for saving and backups)
  - Automatic backup creation (.bak files) before editing
  - Exits with clear error if write permissions are missing
  - Supports ~ expansion and relative/absolute paths
  - Interactive mode with helpful prompts and examples

## What to do next:
- UX/UI needs huge improvements. This is a good place to focus.
