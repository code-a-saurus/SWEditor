## Things we have done so far:
- We've created a main menu loop.
- We've added functions for multi-byte reading and multi-byte writing.
- We've validated our read/writes by enabling cash editing.
- Cash editing works.
- Saving the edited file works.
- We have also added everything necessary for light editing and validated that it works.
- We've added ship software editing and validated it works.
- We've added the functions to handle the party member submenu and its options, specifically the party member selection menu. This is in and validated. We can pick crewpersons 1-5, and also back out.
- We got to the point of displaying this option for the selected crewmember:
  - 1) Edit characteristics
  - 2) Edit abilities
  - 3) Edit HP
  - 4) Edit equipment
- "Edit characteristics" is implemented and functional
- "Edit HP" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit Abilities" is implemented and functional.
- "Edit equipment" is implemented and functional.

## What to do next:
- There are multiple TODOs in the main.py code. I'd suggest those.
- UX/UI needs huge improvements. This is a good place to focuc.
